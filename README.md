It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.


Note: add `${var.ssh_key_pair}` private key to the `ssh agent`.

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code.

### Simple example:

```hcl
module "instance" {
  source = "cloudposse/ec2-instance/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version     = "x.x.x"
  ssh_key_pair                = var.ssh_key_pair
  instance_type               = var.instance_type
  vpc_id                      = var.vpc_id
  security_groups             = var.security_groups
  subnet                      = var.subnet
  name                        = "ec2"
  namespace                   = "eg"
  stage                       = "dev"
}
```

### Example with additional volumes and EIP

```hcl
module "kafka_instance" {
  source = "cloudposse/ec2-instance/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version     = "x.x.x"
  ssh_key_pair                = var.ssh_key_pair
  vpc_id                      = var.vpc_id
  security_groups             = var.security_groups
  subnet                      = var.subnet
  associate_public_ip_address = true
  name                        = "kafka"
  namespace                   = "eg"
  stage                       = "dev"
  additional_ips_count        = 1
  ebs_volume_count            = 2
  allowed_ports               = [22, 80, 443]
}
```
