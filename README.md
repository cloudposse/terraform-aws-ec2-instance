[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance/releases).


Note: add `${var.ssh_key_pair}` private key to the `ssh agent`.

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code.

### Simple example:

```hcl
module "instance" {
  source                      = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance.git?ref=master"
  ssh_key_pair                = var.ssh_key_pair
  instance_type               = var.instance_type
  vpc_id                      = var.vpc_id
  security_groups             = var.security_groups
  subnet                      = var.subnet
  name                        = "ec2"
  namespace                   = "eg"
  stage                       = "dev"
}
```

### Example with additional volumes and EIP

```hcl
module "kafka_instance" {
  source                      = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance.git?ref=master"
  ssh_key_pair                = var.ssh_key_pair
  vpc_id                      = var.vpc_id
  security_groups             = var.security_groups
  subnet                      = var.subnet
  associate_public_ip_address = true
  name                        = "kafka"
  namespace                   = "eg"
  stage                       = "dev"
  additional_ips_count        = 1
  ebs_volume_count            = 2
  allowed_ports               = [22, 80, 443]
}
```
